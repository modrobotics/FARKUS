MISC TODO
########################
*Look for TODOs in code. Duh.
*Enums for Commands
*implement commands to getCurrentConfigState on modules
*Manager class/functions in FarkusTable to manage module location constraints (2 modules in 1 location, etc.)
*Click on part-> Part details window with tests to run, results, serial number, added date/time, etc
*Click on module-> Module details, config.  WE have basic config.  Add buttons/text for manual commands, status debug info
*Ensure everything is properly destroy()'d before close()---memory leak risk
*serial failures aren't properly updating the Statusbar..fix that.
