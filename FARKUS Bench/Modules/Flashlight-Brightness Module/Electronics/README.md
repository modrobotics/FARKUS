FBM-board
======
This is a photograph of the prototype board for the flashlight-brightness tester. This circuit is relatively simple, comprising:
-A switch, to manually swap between flashlight and brightness modes (this is also switchable using serial comm)
-A voltage divider circuit including the photocell to measure flashlight brightness
-A BJT circuit to switch the ultra-bright LED used to test the brightness cubelet.

The two buttons are included with the protoshield kit. One is used as a reset button, the other is to manually start the test. The red and green LEDs indicate fail or pass result of most recent test.
