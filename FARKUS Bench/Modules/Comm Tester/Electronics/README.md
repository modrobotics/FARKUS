Comm board
======
This simple board provides utility functions for the Cubelet communication test. Two MOSFET switch circuits are used to control two pneumatic solenoids that raise and lower the arm. The board also breaks out power connections and servo connections for the end-effector servos.

The two buttons are included in the Sparkfun protoshield kit. One button is used as a reset, the other button starts the test manually. The red and green LEDs indicate fail or pass result of most recent test.
