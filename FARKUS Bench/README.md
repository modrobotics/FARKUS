FARKUS Bench
======

The FARKUS Bench is an assembly of interconnected modules that work together to complete a set of tasks. We use the Bench to test Cubelets.

The Bench comprises the physical Table, the Conveyance, and Modules, along with the Cubelet Holder (which is a type of FARKUS Nest) and some electrical interfaces.

The Table is the mechanical substrate to which Modules and the Conveyance are fixed. Modules are the units that perform tasks, and the Conveyance is a device that advances workpieces (Cubelets, in our case) through the Modules. The Cubelet Holder is a Nest that has been specifically designed to attach Cubelets to the Conveyance, and the electrical interfaces allow Modules to easily connect up to the Table and communicate with one another.
